              <p class="lh-lg text-secondary fs-6">
                In 2016 one of our co-founders almost lost his eyesight after a
                terrible accident while playing football. His education was at
                stake due to his fading vision but luckily for him he was
                diagnosed to have cataract which was later corrected with
                surgery. Happily, our friend was lucky but what about millions
                of other young visually impaired Nigerians and Africans who
                could not get their defects treated or corrected. Most of them
                who had big hopes and dreams have had to drop out of school due
                to difficulties in reading and navigating their environments and
                a good number of them are at home depressed or on the street
                begging for alms. According to WHO’s Global data report on
                Visual impairment about 26.2 people are visually impaired in
                Africa. And it was also estimated that about 32.7 thousand
                people in every 1 million are visually impaired in Africa which
                results to about 6.24million people in Nigeria. This is a whole
                lot of people suffering from lots of discomfort and depression
                due to their condition, especially the young ones who lose out
                on education because of their inabilities to read and navigate
                their environment.

                At vinsighte our aim is to reduce the prevalence of visual
                impairment and to help millions of visually impaired persons
                achieve their dreams by providing a technology which detects eye
                diseases at an early stage and aids the visually impaired to
                read books and navigate their environments independently. This
                means like every other young child, a visually impaired kid in
                Africa can go to school and learn comfortably. And with our
                guiding aids, they would also be able to move around their
                environments independently. Also, with the aid of our diagnostic
                app eye defects and diseases can be detected early thereby
                prompting early treatments of these diseases and preventing
                visual impairment and blindness.
